# Manual Assessment Memo

**MEMORANDUM**

**TO**: CEO of Zojirushi

**FROM**: Kira Discenza

**SUBJECT**: NS-JCC10 User Manual Review

**DATE**: February 10, 2025

I evaluated the manual for the NS-JCC10 Rice Cooker available at: <https://www.manua.ls/zojirushi/ns-jcc10/manual?p=24>

The manual has many strengths, particularly in its organization of information. The use and care instructions are detailed and clear. There were no instructions that were blatantly missing, users reading the manual should be able to find any information they need when using the product. The tables throughout the manual showcasing the size, capacity, and rice measurements were clear and helpful in preparation. The recipe section included at the end of the manual was interesting and useful and lets the end user know that the product can be utilized for much more than just cooking rice.

Upon review, there were several areas I think could be strengthened. Namely, some pages felt overwhelming to read because there was so much text instruction on it. This made it hard to follow and more difficult to find specific instructions. In the recipes section it would have been nice to see more recipes that included ingredients other than rice, so that the user understands the full functionality of the product.

Below are my suggested modifications for the manual:
* Break up the instructions more and allow more white space.
*	Utilize more illustrations and diagrams.
*	Include more diverse recipes.

This assignment was improved using Spellcheck.
