The website I chose to visit is fanfiction.net. While the current version of fanfiction.net isn’t the most modern, the snapshot I visited from 2004 has the telltale look of an early 2000s website. 
<http://web.archive.org/web/20040622183544/http://www.fanfiction.net/>

The first thing that struck me about the older version was the navigation. The novelty of the World Wide Web was still fresh at the time of many older website’s conception, I believe that because of this, functionality reigned, with less focus on design and streamlining. As the web progressed, more focus was put on convenience and ease of access. In 2004, Fanfiction lacked an intuitive menu navigation system that had me faltering on where to go when I was first looking at it. As a modern internet user, I’ve come to expect a clearly labeled and easily visible menu or tabs to navigate the site.

The other thing that caught my attention were the visuals of the website. I have always found that older websites are rather rough on the eyes, perhaps due to the fact that a lot of them, including fanfiction.net, consist chiefly of two things: text and hyperlinks. There is also the other end of the spectrum of old websites that crowds the eye with bright and numerous pictures and graphics. Websites now typically put a specific focus on visual interest, not just how many pictures and colors can fit on this page, but what will please the eye and draw people in to visit again. More thoughtfully placed graphics and dedicated color schemes make modern websites a more pleasant visual experience than that of older websites.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
