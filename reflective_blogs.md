# Wayback Analysis

The website I chose to visit is fanfiction.net. While the current version of fanfiction.net isn‚Äôt the most modern, the snapshot I visited from 2004 has the telltale look of an early 2000s website. 
<http://web.archive.org/web/20040622183544/http://www.fanfiction.net/>

The first thing that struck me about the older version was the navigation. The novelty of the World Wide Web was still fresh at the time of many older website‚Äôs conception, I believe that because of this, functionality reigned, with less focus on design and streamlining. As the web progressed, more focus was put on convenience and ease of access. In 2004, Fanfiction lacked an intuitive menu navigation system that had me faltering on where to go when I was first looking at it. As a modern internet user, I‚Äôve come to expect a clearly labeled and easily visible menu or tabs to navigate the site.

The other thing that caught my attention were the visuals of the website. I have always found that older websites are rather rough on the eyes, perhaps due to the fact that a lot of them, including fanfiction.net, consist chiefly of two things: text and hyperlinks. There is also the other end of the spectrum of old websites that crowds the eye with bright and numerous pictures and graphics. Websites now typically put a specific focus on visual interest, not just how many pictures and colors can fit on this page, but what will please the eye and draw people in to visit again. More thoughtfully placed graphics and dedicated color schemes make modern websites a more pleasant visual experience than that of older websites.

#### Prompt Q: Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn?

My resume was uploaded to ChatGPT, where the AI tool was prompted to generate the job that my resume would most closely match with, and asked to list ways to improve the document. The jobs that ChatGPT said matched my resume the most are below:

* IT Support Intern ‚Äì Your customer service experience shows strong communication skills, and your TestOut IT Fundamentals Pro certification indicates a basic understanding of IT concepts.
* Help Desk Technician (Intern/Entry-Level) ‚Äì Your mix of technical knowledge and customer service experience aligns well with help desk roles, where troubleshooting and assisting users are key.
* Junior Data Entry Specialist ‚Äì Your experience with MySQL and Microsoft Office suggests you could handle data-related tasks.

When asked for suggestions on how to improve my resume, I was told to add relevant coursework I have completed in my studies, like "Networking Fundamentals" or "Database Management". Currently my resume is focused more on things I have done or specific programs I know, there isn't a lot of general skills, whether technical or soft. I think adding skills like this would help my resume a lot and show employers what I can offer. I was also suggested to add personal and academic projects related to IT, this suggestion wasn't very helpful since I don't have any projects like this under my belt, but it would be valuable if I did. The last suggestion that ChatGPT gave me was to add more certifications to my resume. Of course, any industry related certifications will help boost the strength of a resume, and I'm currently in the process of getting another certification so I can bolster my resume even more.

ChatGPT gave several good suggestions for improving my resume, some of which I will implement to hopefully help in my future job-finding endeavors.
