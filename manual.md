## Introduction

### Why mod Skyrim?

Welcome to the world of Skyrim modding—where your adventure never ends, and your imagination shapes the journey. Whether you’re new to the game or a seasoned Dragonborn, modding opens up a whole new dimension of possibilities. From breathtaking visual upgrades and combat overhauls to immersive quests and quality-of-life tweaks, mods allow you to tailor Skyrim into the game you wish it always was.

### What this manual covers

This manual is designed for players who want to dive deep into modding without touching the complexities of mod creation. You won’t need to write scripts or build your own dungeons—just follow along, and you’ll be installing and managing mods like a pro in no time. All you need is a bit of curiosity, some patience, and a love for the world of Tamriel.

This manual will walk you through setting up your game properly, using key tools, building a stable load order, and curating a personalized mod list for the best experience possible. Let’s turn vanilla Skyrim into something truly legendary.

## Preparing Your Game

Before installing your first mod, it's crucial to prepare your Skyrim installation properly—think of it as laying the foundation before building a house. Modding can push the game far beyond its original limits, so starting clean and organized is key to avoiding crashes, bugs, and performance headaches down the line.

### Choosing your version

First, decide which version of Skyrim you’ll be modding: The Special Edition (SE) or the Anniversary Edition (AE). SE is the most stable and widely supported by modern mods, while AE includes additional content that may cause compatibility issues unless you're careful with your mod setup. Most mods are dual supported by both version, but some are only supported by one, so picking one version is best.

### Disabling automatic updates

A fresh install with no lingering mods or saves is highly recommended. You’ll also want to disable automatic updates through Steam to avoid breaking your mod setup unexpectedly. Trust us—it’s better to set everything up right the first time than to troubleshoot a messy modded game later.

Once your Skyrim installation is clean and stable, you’re ready to install the essential tools that will help manage your mods smoothly and safely.

# An Easy Start - Using Creations

If you’re interested in enhancing your Skyrim experience without diving headfirst into community modding, the Creation Club offers a simple, low-maintenance alternative. Included with the Anniversary Edition (or available for purchase separately in the Special Edition), these "Creations" are official, curated add-ons developed by Bethesda and selected community creators.

### What are Creations?

Creations include new quests, armor sets, weapons, spells, dungeons, and even game mechanics like fishing and survival mode. Unlike traditional mods, they integrate seamlessly with the game and require no special tools or mod managers—just enable or disable them in the game’s main menu. To access them, there is a button in the main menu of the game titled "Creations", located under the "New game" and "Load game" buttons that will take you to the Creations home page, pictured above.

While Creation Club content is more limited in scope than community mods, it’s a great way to freshen up your playthrough with minimal setup. It’s also fully supported by Bethesda, meaning it's unlikely to break your game or conflict with updates.

If you’re the type of player who just wants “a little something extra” without the overhead of learning modding tools, this is your perfect starting point. Later on, if you want more control or more ambitious changes, the rest of this manual will guide you into the world of full modding.
